## Settings for the Sieve interpreter
##

# Do not forget to enable the Sieve plugin in 15-lda.conf and 20-lmtp.conf
# by adding it to the respective mail_plugins= settings.

# The Sieve interpreter can retrieve Sieve scripts from several types of
# locations. The default `file' location type is a local filesystem path
# pointing to a Sieve script file or a directory containing multiple Sieve
# script files. More complex setups can use other location types such as
# `ldap' or `dict' to fetch Sieve scripts from remote databases.
#
# All settings that specify the location of one ore more Sieve scripts accept
# the following syntax:
#
# location = [&lt;type&gt;:]path[;&lt;option&gt;[=&lt;value&gt;][;...]]
#
# If the type prefix is omitted, the script location type is 'file' and the
# location is interpreted as a local filesystem path pointing to a Sieve script
# file or directory. Refer to Pigeonhole wiki or INSTALL file for more
# information.

plugin {
  # The location of the user's main Sieve script or script storage. The LDA
  # Sieve plugin uses this to find the active script for Sieve filtering at
  # delivery. The &quot;include&quot; extension uses this location for retrieving
  # :personal&quot; scripts. This is also where the  ManageSieve service will store
  # the user's scripts, if supported.
  #
  # Currently only the 'file:' location type supports ManageSieve operation.
  # Other location types like 'dict:' and 'ldap:' can currently only
  # be used as a read-only script source ().
  #
  # For the 'file:' type: use the ';active=' parameter to specify where the
  # active script symlink is located.
  # For other types: use the ';name=' parameter to specify the name of the
  # default/active script.

  #     script.

  # file names, using a normal 8bit per-character comparison.
  #
  # Multiple script locations can be specified by appending an increasing number
  # to the setting name. The Sieve scripts found from these locations are added
  # to the script execution sequence in the specified order. Reading the

  # (above), meaning that the extensions enabled with this setting are never
  # available to the user's personal script no matter what is specified for the
  # `sieve_extensions' setting. The syntax of this setting is similar to the
