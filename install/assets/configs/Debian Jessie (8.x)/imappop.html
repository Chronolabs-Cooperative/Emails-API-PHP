# &quot;doveconf -n&quot; command gives a clean output of the changed settings. Use it
# instead of copy&amp;pasting files when posting to the Dovecot mailing list.

# '#' character and everything after it is treated as comments. Extra spaces
# and tabs are ignored. If you want to use either of these explicitly, put the
# value inside quotes, eg.: key = &quot;# char and trailing whitespace  &quot;

# Most (but not all) settings can be overridden by different protocols and/or
# source/destination IPs by placing the settings inside sections, for example:
# protocol imap { }, local 127.0.0.1 { }, remote 10.0.0.0/8 { }

# Default values are shown for each setting, it's not required to uncomment
# those. These are exceptions to this though: No sections (e.g. namespace {})
# or plugin settings are added by default, they're listed only as examples.

#
# For the sql passdb module, you'll need a database with a table that
# contains fields for at least the username and password. If you want to
# use the user@domain syntax, you might want to have a separate domain
# field as well.
#
# If your users all have the same uig/gid, and have predictable home
# directories, you can use the static userdb module to generate the home
# dir based on the username and domain. In this case, you won't need fields
# for home, uid, or gid in the database.
#
# If you prefer to use the sql userdb module, you'll want to add fields
# for home, uid, and gid. Here is an example table:
#
# CREATE TABLE users (
#     username VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
#     domain VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
#     password VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,

#
# HA / round-robin load-balancing is supported by giving multiple host

#
# pgsql:
#   For available options, see the PostgreSQL documention for the

#   Use maxconns=n (default 5) to change how many connections Dovecot can
#   create to pgsql.
#
# mysql:
#   Basic options emulate PostgreSQL option names:
#     host, port, user, password, dbname
#
#   But also adds some new settings:
#     client_flags           - See MySQL manual
#     ssl_ca, ssl_ca_path    - Set either one or both to enable SSL
#     ssl_cert, ssl_key      - For sending client-side certificates to server

#   connect = /etc/dovecot/authdb.sqlite

# passdb query to retrieve the password. It can return fields:
#   password - The user's password. This field must be returned.
#   user - user@domain from the database. Needed with case-insensitive lookups.
#   username and domain - An alternative way to represent the &quot;user&quot; field.
#
# The &quot;user&quot; field is often necessary with case-insensitive lookups to avoid
# e.g. &quot;name&quot; and &quot;nAme&quot; logins creating two different mail directories. If
# your user and domain names are in separate fields, you can return &quot;username&quot;
# and &quot;domain&quot; fields instead of &quot;user&quot;.
#
# The query can also return other fields which have a special meaning, see
# http://wiki2.dovecot.org/PasswordDatabase/ExtraFields
#
# Commonly used available substitutions (see http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Variables
# for full list):
#   %u = entire user@domain
#   %n = user part of user@domain
#   %d = domain part of user@domain
#
# Note that these can be used only as input to SQL query. If the query outputs
# any of these substitutions, they're not touched. Otherwise it would be
# difficult to have eg. usernames containing '%' characters.
#
# Example:
#   password_query = SELECT userid AS user, pw AS password \
#     FROM users WHERE userid = '%u' AND active = 'Y'
#
#password_query = \
#  SELECT username, domain, password \
#  FROM users WHERE username = '%n' AND domain = '%d'

# userdb query to retrieve the user information. It can return fields:
#   uid - System UID (overrides mail_uid setting)
#   gid - System GID (overrides mail_gid setting)
#   home - Home directory
#   mail - Mail location (overrides mail_location setting)
#
# None of these are strictly required. If you use a single UID and GID, and
# home or mail directory fits to a template string, you could use userdb static
# instead. For a list of all fields that can be returned, see
# http://wiki2.dovecot.org/UserDatabase/ExtraFields
#
# Examples:
#   user_query = SELECT home, uid, gid FROM users WHERE userid = '%u'
#   user_query = SELECT dir AS home, user AS uid, group AS gid FROM users where userid = '%u'
#   user_query = SELECT home, 501 AS uid, 501 AS gid FROM users WHERE userid = '%u'
#
#user_query = \
#  SELECT home, uid, gid \
#  FROM users WHERE username = '%n' AND domain = '%d'
user_query = SELECT CONCAT(homedir, maildir) AS home, CONCAT('maildir:', homedir, maildir) AS mail, uid, gid, CONCAT('*:storage=', quota, 'M') as quota_rule FROM %tablemailusers WHERE (username = '%u' OR email = '%u')

# If you wish to avoid two SQL lookups (passdb + userdb), you can use
# userdb prefetch instead of userdb sql in dovecot.conf. In that case you'll
# also have to return userdb fields in password_query prefixed with &quot;userdb_&quot;
# string. For example:
#password_query = \
#  SELECT userid AS user, password, \
#    home AS userdb_home, uid AS userdb_uid, gid AS userdb_gid \
#  FROM users WHERE userid = '%u'
password_query = SELECT username AS user, password_enc AS password, CONCAT(homedir, maildir) AS userdb_home, uid AS userdb_uid, gid AS userdb_gid,  CONCAT('maildir:', homedir, maildir) AS userdb_mail, CONCAT('*:storage=', quota, 'M') as userdb_quota_rule FROM %tablemailusers WHERE (username = '%u' OR email = '%u') AND ((imap = 1 AND '%Ls' = 'imap') OR (pop3 = 1 AND '%Ls' = 'pop3') OR '%Ls' = 'smtp' OR '%Ls' = 'sieve')

## Mailbox locations and namespaces
##

# Location for users' mailboxes. The default is empty, which means that Dovecot
# tries to find the mailboxes automatically. This won't work if the user
# doesn't yet have any mail, so you should explicitly tell Dovecot the full
# location.
#
# If you're using mbox, giving a path to the INBOX file (eg. /var/mail/%u)
# isn't enough. You'll also need to tell Dovecot where the other mailboxes are
# kept. This is called the &quot;root mail directory&quot;, and it must be the first
# path given in the mail_location setting.
#
# There are a few special variables you can use, eg.:
#
#   %u - username
#   %n - user part in user@domain, same as %u if there's no domain
#   %d - domain part in user@domain, empty if there's no domain
#   %h - home directory
#
# See doc/wiki/Variables.txt for full list. Some examples:
#
#   mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
#   mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
#   mail_location = mbox:/var/mail/%d/%1n/%n:INDEX=/var/indexes/%d/%1n/%n
#
# &lt;doc/wiki/MailLocation.txt&gt;
#
mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u

# If you need to set multiple mailbox locations or want to change default
# namespace settings, you can do it by defining namespace sections.
#
# You can have private, shared and public namespaces. Private namespaces
# are for user's personal mails. Shared namespaces are for accessing other
# users' mailboxes that have been shared. Public namespaces are for shared
# mailboxes that are managed by sysadmin. If you create any shared or public
# namespaces you'll typically want to enable ACL plugin also, otherwise all
# users can access all the shared mailboxes, assuming they have permissions
# on filesystem level to do so.
namespace inbox {
  # Namespace type: private, shared or public

  # Hierarchy separator to use. You should use the same separator for all
  # namespaces or some clients get confused. '/' is usually a good one.

  # If namespace is hidden, it's not advertised to clients via NAMESPACE
  # extension. You'll most likely also want to set list=no. This is mostly
  # useful when converting from another server with different namespaces which

  # hidden namespaces with prefixes &quot;~/mail/&quot;, &quot;~%u/mail/&quot; and &quot;mail/&quot;.
  #hidden = no

# Which locking methods to use for locking mbox. There are four available:
#  dotlock: Create &lt;mailbox&gt;.lock file. This is the oldest and most NFS-safe
#           solution. If you want to use /var/mail/ like directory, the users
#           will need write access to that directory.
#  dotlock_try: Same as dotlock, but if it fails because of permissions or
#               because there isn't enough disk space, just skip it.
#  fcntl  : Use this if possible. Works with NFS too if lockd is used.
#  flock  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#  lockf  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#
# You can use multiple locking methods; if you do the order they're declared
# in is important to avoid deadlocks if other MTAs/MUAs are using multiple
# locking methods as well. Some operating systems don't allow using some of
# them simultaneously.
#
# The Debian value for mbox_write_locks differs from upstream Dovecot. It is

# When mbox changes unexpectedly we have to fully read it to find out what
# changed. If the mbox is large this can take a long time. Since the change
# is usually just a newly appended mail, it'd be faster to simply read the
# new mails. If this setting is enabled, Dovecot does this but still safely
# fallbacks to re-reading the whole mbox file whenever something in mbox isn't
# how it's expected to be. The only real downside to this setting is that if

  # The default Sieve script when the user has none. This is a path to a global
  # sieve script file, which gets executed ONLY if user's private Sieve script
  # doesn't exist. Be sure to pre-compile this script manually using the sievec
  # command line tool.

  #     script.

  # Path to a script file or a directory containing script files that need to be
  # executed before the user's script. If the path points to a directory, all
  # the Sieve scripts contained therein (with the proper .sieve extension) are
  # executed. The order of execution within a directory is determined by the
  # file names, using a normal 8bit per-character comparison. Multiple script
  # file or directory paths can be specified by appending an increasing number.

  # supported extensions are available, except for deprecated extensions or
  # those that are still under development. Some system administrators may want
  # to disable certain Sieve extensions or enable those that are not available
  # by default. This setting can use '+' and '-' to specify differences relative
  # to the default. For example `sieve_extensions = +imapflags' will enable the
	# deprecated imapflags extension in addition to all extensions were already
  # enabled by default.

  # Which Sieve language extensions are ONLY available in global scripts. This
  # can be used to restrict the use of certain Sieve extensions to administrator
  # control, for instance when these extensions can cause security concerns.
  # This setting has higher precedence than the `sieve_extensions' setting
  # (above), meaning that the extensions enabled with this setting are never
  # available to the user's personal script no matter what is specified for the
  # `sieve_extensions' setting. The syntax of this setting is similar to the
  # `sieve_extensions' setting, with the difference that extensions are
  # enabled or disabled for exclusive use in global scripts. Currently, no
  # extensions are marked as such by default.
