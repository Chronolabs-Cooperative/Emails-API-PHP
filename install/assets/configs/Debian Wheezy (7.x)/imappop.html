#
# For the sql passdb module, you'll need a database with a table that
# contains fields for at least the username and password. If you want to
# use the user@domain syntax, you might want to have a separate domain
# field as well.
#
# If your users all have the same uig/gid, and have predictable home
# directories, you can use the static userdb module to generate the home
# dir based on the username and domain. In this case, you won't need fields
# for home, uid, or gid in the database.
#
# If you prefer to use the sql userdb module, you'll want to add fields
# for home, uid, and gid. Here is an example table:
#
# CREATE TABLE users (
#     username VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
#     domain VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
#     password VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
#     home VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
#     uid INTEGER NOT NULL,
#     gid INTEGER NOT NULL,
#     active CHAR(1) DEFAULT 'Y' NOT NULL
# );

# Database driver: mysql, pgsql, sqlite
driver = mysql

# Database connection string. This is driver-specific setting.
#
# HA / round-robin load-balancing is supported by giving multiple host
# settings, like: host=sql1.host.org host=sql2.host.org
#
# pgsql:
#   For available options, see the PostgreSQL documention for the
#   PQconnectdb function of libpq.
#   Use maxconns=n (default 5) to change how many connections Dovecot can
#   create to pgsql.
#
# mysql:
#   Basic options emulate PostgreSQL option names:
#     host, port, user, password, dbname
#
#   But also adds some new settings:
#     client_flags        - See MySQL manual
#     ssl_ca, ssl_ca_path - Set either one or both to enable SSL
#     ssl_cert, ssl_key   - For sending client-side certificates to server
#     ssl_cipher          - Set minimum allowed cipher security (default: HIGH)
#     option_file         - Read options from the given file instead of
#                           the default my.cnf location
#     option_group        - Read options from the given group (default: client)
#
#   You can connect to UNIX sockets by using host: host=/var/run/mysql.sock
#   Note that currently you can't use spaces in parameters.
#
# sqlite:
#   The path to the database file.
#
# Examples:
#   connect = host=192.168.1.1 dbname=users
#   connect = host=sql.example.com dbname=virtual user=virtual password=blarg
#   connect = /etc/dovecot/authdb.sqlite
#
connect = host=%dbhost dbname=%dbname user=%dbuser password=%dbpassword

# Default password scheme.
#
# List of supported schemes is in
# http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Authentication/PasswordSchemes
#
default_pass_scheme = CRYPT

# passdb query to retrieve the password. It can return fields:
#   password - The user's password. This field must be returned.
#   user - user@domain from the database. Needed with case-insensitive lookups.
#   username and domain - An alternative way to represent the &quot;user&quot; field.
#
# The &quot;user&quot; field is often necessary with case-insensitive lookups to avoid
# e.g. &quot;name&quot; and &quot;nAme&quot; logins creating two different mail directories. If
# your user and domain names are in separate fields, you can return &quot;username&quot;
# and &quot;domain&quot; fields instead of &quot;user&quot;.
#
# The query can also return other fields which have a special meaning, see
# http://wiki2.dovecot.org/PasswordDatabase/ExtraFields
#
# Commonly used available substitutions (see http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Variables
# for full list):
#   %u = entire user@domain
#   %n = user part of user@domain
#   %d = domain part of user@domain
#
# Note that these can be used only as input to SQL query. If the query outputs
# any of these substitutions, they're not touched. Otherwise it would be
# difficult to have eg. usernames containing '%' characters.
#
# Example:
#   password_query = SELECT userid AS user, pw AS password \
#     FROM users WHERE userid = '%u' AND active = 'Y'
#
#password_query = \
#  SELECT username, domain, password \
#  FROM users WHERE username = '%n' AND domain = '%d'

# userdb query to retrieve the user information. It can return fields:
#   uid - System UID (overrides mail_uid setting)
#   gid - System GID (overrides mail_gid setting)
#   home - Home directory
#   mail - Mail location (overrides mail_location setting)
#
# None of these are strictly required. If you use a single UID and GID, and
# home or mail directory fits to a template string, you could use userdb static
# instead. For a list of all fields that can be returned, see
# http://wiki2.dovecot.org/UserDatabase/ExtraFields
#
# Examples:
#   user_query = SELECT home, uid, gid FROM users WHERE userid = '%u'
#   user_query = SELECT dir AS home, user AS uid, group AS gid FROM users where userid = '%u'
#   user_query = SELECT home, 501 AS uid, 501 AS gid FROM users WHERE userid = '%u'
#
#user_query = \
#  SELECT home, uid, gid \
#  FROM users WHERE username = '%n' AND domain = '%d'
user_query = SELECT CONCAT(homedir, maildir) AS home, CONCAT('maildir:', homedir, maildir) AS mail, uid, gid, CONCAT('*:storage=', quota, 'M') as quota_rule FROM %tablemailusers WHERE (username = '%u' OR email = '%u')

# If you wish to avoid two SQL lookups (passdb + userdb), you can use
# userdb prefetch instead of userdb sql in dovecot.conf. In that case you'll
# also have to return userdb fields in password_query prefixed with &quot;userdb_&quot;
# string. For example:
#password_query = \
#  SELECT userid AS user, password, \
#    home AS userdb_home, uid AS userdb_uid, gid AS userdb_gid \
#  FROM users WHERE userid = '%u'
password_query = SELECT username AS user, password_enc AS password, CONCAT(homedir, maildir) AS userdb_home, uid AS userdb_uid, gid AS userdb_gid,  CONCAT('maildir:', homedir, maildir) AS userdb_mail, CONCAT('*:storage=', quota, 'M') as userdb_quota_rule FROM %tablemailusers WHERE (username = '%u' OR email = '%u') AND ((imap = 1 AND '%Ls' = 'imap') OR (pop3 = 1 AND '%Ls' = 'pop3') OR '%Ls' = 'smtp' OR '%Ls' = 'sieve')

## Mailbox locations and namespaces
##

# Location for users' mailboxes. The default is empty, which means that Dovecot
# tries to find the mailboxes automatically. This won't work if the user
# doesn't yet have any mail, so you should explicitly tell Dovecot the full
# location.
#
# If you're using mbox, giving a path to the INBOX file (eg. /var/mail/%u)
# isn't enough. You'll also need to tell Dovecot where the other mailboxes are
# kept. This is called the &quot;root mail directory&quot;, and it must be the first
# path given in the mail_location setting.
#
# There are a few special variables you can use, eg.:
#
#   %u - username
#   %n - user part in user@domain, same as %u if there's no domain
#   %d - domain part in user@domain, empty if there's no domain
#   %h - home directory
#
# See doc/wiki/Variables.txt for full list. Some examples:
#
#   mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
#   mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
#   mail_location = mbox:/var/mail/%d/%1n/%n:INDEX=/var/indexes/%d/%1n/%n
#
# &lt;doc/wiki/MailLocation.txt&gt;
#
mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u

# If you need to set multiple mailbox locations or want to change default
# namespace settings, you can do it by defining namespace sections.
#
# You can have private, shared and public namespaces. Private namespaces
# are for user's personal mails. Shared namespaces are for accessing other
# users' mailboxes that have been shared. Public namespaces are for shared
# mailboxes that are managed by sysadmin. If you create any shared or public
# namespaces you'll typically want to enable ACL plugin also, otherwise all
# users can access all the shared mailboxes, assuming they have permissions
# on filesystem level to do so.
namespace inbox {
  # Namespace type: private, shared or public
  #type = private

  # Hierarchy separator to use. You should use the same separator for all
  # namespaces or some clients get confused. '/' is usually a good one.

  # If namespace is hidden, it's not advertised to clients via NAMESPACE
  # extension. You'll most likely also want to set list=no. This is mostly
  # useful when converting from another server with different namespaces which
  # you want to deprecate but still keep working. For example you can create
  # hidden namespaces with prefixes &quot;~/mail/&quot;, &quot;~%u/mail/&quot; and &quot;mail/&quot;.
  #hidden = no

#mailbox_idle_check_interval = 30 secs

# Save mails with CR+LF instead of plain LF. This makes sending those mails
# take less CPU, especially with sendfile() syscall with Linux and FreeBSD.

# Also note that if other software reads the mboxes/maildirs, they may handle

# done always regardless of this setting)

# Which locking methods to use for locking mbox. There are four available:
#  dotlock: Create &lt;mailbox&gt;.lock file. This is the oldest and most NFS-safe
#           solution. If you want to use /var/mail/ like directory, the users
#           will need write access to that directory.
#  dotlock_try: Same as dotlock, but if it fails because of permissions or
#               because there isn't enough disk space, just skip it.
#  fcntl  : Use this if possible. Works with NFS too if lockd is used.
#  flock  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#  lockf  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#
# You can use multiple locking methods; if you do the order they're declared
# in is important to avoid deadlocks if other MTAs/MUAs are using multiple
# locking methods as well. Some operating systems don't allow using some of
# them simultaneously.
#mbox_read_locks = fcntl

# When mbox changes unexpectedly we have to fully read it to find out what
# changed. If the mbox is large this can take a long time. Since the change
# is usually just a newly appended mail, it'd be faster to simply read the
# new mails. If this setting is enabled, Dovecot does this but still safely
# fallbacks to re-reading the whole mbox file whenever something in mbox isn't
# how it's expected to be. The only real downside to this setting is that if
# some other MUA changes message flags, Dovecot doesn't notice it immediately.
# Note that a full sync is done with SELECT, EXAMINE, EXPUNGE and CHECK
# commands.
#mbox_dirty_syncs = yes

# EXPUNGE or CHECK commands. If this is set, mbox_dirty_syncs is ignored.
#mbox_very_dirty_syncs = no

# Delay writing mbox headers until doing a full write sync (EXPUNGE and CHECK
# commands and when closing the mailbox). This is especially useful for POP3
# where clients often delete all mails. The downside is that our changes
# aren't immediately visible to other MUAs.
